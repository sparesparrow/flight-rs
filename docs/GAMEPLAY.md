# Forbidden Knowledge: The Anarcho-Capitalist Lore

![1984 meets AnCap](https://i.ibb.co/87vWJGJ/anarkoflight-sim.png)

## Introduction

In the dystopian world of our Flight Simulator RPG, inspired by Orwell's 1984, the Party controls all thought and expression. Citizens are constantly monitored by telescreens, and any deviation from Party doctrine is classified as "thoughtcrime."

Our game introduces a distinctive twist: the discovery of forbidden knowledge in the form of anarcho-capitalist philosophy - texts that propose radical ideas like voluntary exchange, non-aggression, and individual freedom from state control. These ideas directly challenge the totalitarian regime and offer a path to mental liberation.

## Visual Design

The visual design of the game reflects this thematic duality:
- **Dark Red**: Represents the oppressive surveillance state, fear, and control
- **Black and Gold**: Symbolizes the anarcho-capitalist ideas of freedom and voluntary exchange

As players discover and internalize more forbidden knowledge, the game's interface will gradually shift from red to gold, representing their mental journey from slavish compliance to independent thought.

## Core Mechanics

### Discovering Forbidden Texts

Players can find fragments of anarcho-capitalist texts hidden throughout the world:

- **Search for Texts**: Use the `SearchForForbiddenTexts` action in certain locations
- **Risk vs. Reward**: Searching carries the risk of increasing suspicion if caught
- **Location Matters**: Some locations are safer for searching than others:
  - Prole District: Minimal surveillance, good place to search
  - Charrington's Shop: Secret room above the shop is ideal
  - Ministry of Truth: Extremely dangerous but contains valuable texts

### Reading and Learning

Once discovered, texts can be read to gain knowledge:

- **Language Barrier**: Most texts are in Czech, adding difficulty in understanding
- **Comprehension**: Reading increases understanding of specific anarcho-capitalist topics
- **Risk**: Reading forbidden materials increases both thoughtcrime and suspicion stats

### Knowledge Topics

Players gradually build understanding in five core areas:

1. **Principles of Non-Aggression**: Understanding that force should only be used in self-defense
2. **Voluntary Exchange**: The concept that all interactions should be consensual
3. **Free Market Economy**: How markets function without state intervention
4. **Private Property Rights**: The importance of ownership and property
5. **Decentralization**: The benefits of distributed power over centralization

### Gameplay Effects

As understanding increases, players unlock new capabilities:

- **Economic Freedom Score**: Rises as knowledge increases, enabling more voluntary actions
- **Visual Changes**: UI gradually transitions from oppressive red to freedom-oriented gold
- **New Interactions**: Ability to engage in voluntary exchanges with specific NPCs
- **Resistance Options**: Methods to temporarily disable or avoid telescreen surveillance

## Sharing Knowledge

One of the most powerful (and dangerous) actions is sharing forbidden knowledge:

- **Target Selection**: Choose which NPC to share knowledge with
- **Approach**: Select from different sharing approaches:
  - **Subtle**: Least risky, but limited understanding transfer
  - **Direct**: Most effective but highest risk
  - **Metaphoric**: Uses allegories and indirect references
  - **Questioning**: Socratic method to guide others to question authority
- **Consequences**: Sharing can build trust with like-minded NPCs or lead to betrayal by Party loyalists

## Voluntary Exchange System

Inspired by anarcho-capitalist philosophy, the game features a voluntary exchange system:

- **Trade Items**: Exchange goods with NPCs through voluntary agreements
- **Information Exchange**: Trade goods for knowledge about anarcho-capitalist ideas
- **Relationship Building**: Successful exchanges improve relationships with NPCs
- **Economic Score**: Each successful voluntary exchange increases economic freedom score

## Risk Management

The core tension comes from balancing knowledge acquisition against regime suspicion:

- **Suspicion Level**: Increases with subversive activities
- **Thoughtcrime Score**: Rises as you internalize forbidden ideas
- **Telescreen Warnings**: Visual and audio alerts when suspicious behaviors are detected
- **Surveillance Evasion**: Techniques to temporarily disable or avoid monitoring
- **Consequences**: High suspicion can lead to:
  - Increased monitoring
  - NPC betrayal
  - Interrogation
  - Arrest and game over

## Creating Your Identity

The choices players make regarding forbidden knowledge shape their character's destiny:

- **True Believer**: Reject forbidden knowledge, maintain low suspicion
- **Double-Thinker**: Balance some forbidden knowledge with outward compliance
- **Revolutionary**: Embrace anarcho-capitalist ideas fully despite high risks
- **Evangelist**: Focus on sharing knowledge with others to spread the ideas

## Czech Language Integration

The forbidden texts appear primarily in Czech, with occasional English translations:

- **Language Barrier**: Adds realism and challenge to understanding the texts
- **Translation Mechanic**: Players can invest time to translate and better understand fragments
- **Cultural Authenticity**: Draws from real Czech anarcho-capitalist philosophy

## End Goals

The game offers multiple paths to "victory":

1. **Mental Freedom**: Achieve high economic freedom score while staying alive
2. **Knowledge Network**: Successfully share forbidden knowledge with multiple NPCs
3. **Escape**: Use knowledge to plan an escape from the regime
4. **Revolution**: The ultimate (nearly impossible) goal of sparking wider resistance
