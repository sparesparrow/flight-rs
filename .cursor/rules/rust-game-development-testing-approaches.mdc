- use `cargo run --bin server` to run the game serving on LAN on `http://192.168.200.158:8080/` and always ensure there is just one instance of the game running locally with the latest working version of the game
- once server is ready, test client from another terminal (and then with various client tools, i.e. with `curl`, `firefox`, `docker`, etc.)
- use screenshots and analyze them in integration tests
- update docs with relevant screenshot
